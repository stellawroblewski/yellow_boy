Description 


The game I made is based off of pacman and was altered from pong. The yellowboy moves around the window using the “ijkl” keys. As he moves he is able to pick up food, each worth one point. There are also treats which are larger and worth ten points that appear less frequently. As the enemy in the game, there are ghostboys moving around randomly that move slightly faster than yellowboy. There direction changes so that their movement is not predictable. If the yellowboy comes in contact with a ghostboy, yellowboy’s score decreases by 10 and he loses a life. When yellowboy’s score reaches increments of 100, he levels up. When a level increases, the color scheme changes, there are more ghostboys who move more quickly and a smaller concentration of treats. There are 5 increasingly difficult levels, if the fifth is reached you have won the game.
